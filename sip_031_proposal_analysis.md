## Executive Summary

SIP-031, also known as SIP-31, is a significant draft proposal for the Stacks ecosystem that aims to fuel growth and support builders by creating a new growth-focused treasury and a streamlined operational structure. The proposal acknowledges the need to realign existing structures with the current regulatory and competitive landscape, drawing on six years of practical experience to address day-to-day frictions and blockers within the decentralized ecosystem.

### Authors
- Mitchell Cuevas (Stacks Foundation)
- Tycho Onnasch (Zest)
- Jakob Schillinger (Hermetica)
- Andre Serrano (Bitcoin L2 Labs)
- Dylan Floyd (Bitflow)

### Initial Statement
Tycho initiated the discussion on SIP-031, stating:
> "SIP-031... has been compiled with the help of many and is in a draft state as we begin to further socialize and collect feedback. You may still see some placeholders or comments as you work through it, so don't mind the dust!"

---

## Purpose and Proposed Changes

### Core Objectives

The core objective of SIP-031 is to sustainably increase resources and efficiency to enable contributors, builders, and holders, ultimately activating the Bitcoin economy and onboarding the next billion users to Bitcoin.

The proposal authors collectively identified that SIP-031 is:
> "a direct response to feedback from builders expressing their evolving needs as Stacks scales and a recognition of the opportunity to realign structures with the current regulatory and competitive landscape"

It is further informed by:
> "practical experience gained over 6 years since the establishment of the ecosystem, solving for the day-to-day frictions and blockers that emerged as overhead over time given the lack of clear structure for a decentralized ecosystem"

### Key Proposed Changes

#### Creation of New Consolidated Ecosystem Endowment
- **Funding Source**: The SIP proposes the "creation of a new consolidated ecosystem Endowment"
- **Funding Mechanism**: This Endowment would be funded through "a combination of STX transfers from existing entities and people, a one-time mint of 100m STX to provide initial working capital... and build a longer term treasury through new emissions over the next 5 years that temporarily bring Stacks' annual emissions from 3.52% to an average of 5.75% per year"
- **Future Commitment**: It is explicitly stated that "No further treasury mints are planned beyond this endowment"

#### Strategic Deployment Areas
Strategic deployment of treasury funds across key areas such as:
- DeFi incentives
- sBTC TVL milestones
- Stablecoin integrations
- Grant programs
- Centralized exchange listings
- Core protocol upgrades
- Institutional support
- Developer traction

### Funding Structure

#### Emission Rate Determination
The target emissions rate was determined by:
> "first estimating the total resources necessary to achieve the stated objectives in this SIP over the first 5 years of the Endowment... based on comparisons to other Top 50 crypto ecosystems"

#### Market Strategy
The Endowment's strategy for bringing its tokens to market:
> "will be publicly disclosed and committed to so ecosystem members have full visibility into the plans"

### Operational Structure

Establishment of a streamlined operational structure with three primary organizations (including the Stacks Foundation focusing on governance and the SIP process) to enhance efficiency while maintaining decentralization and community-driven governance.

#### Decentralization Safeguards
The SIP:
> "does not confer any unique protocol governance or technical decision-making capabilities to the new operational entity; its existence is merely as contributor to the ecosystem with an explicit focus to de-duplicate back-end effort required to support development"

### Transparency and Accountability

A commitment to transparency and accountability, with specific mandates:

#### Reporting Requirements
The Endowment is:
> "mandated to produce and publish a detailed annual report, covering what programs were undertaken in the prior year, the impact of those programs, as well as comprehensive financial reporting as to the use of funds for the year for both programs and operations"

#### On-Chain Transparency
Alexlmiller further clarified intentions in a revised draft, stating that:
> "all funds should flow through publicly published on-chain addresses to be traceable by the community"

#### Voting Restrictions
Additionally:
> "the Endowment will also be prohibited from voting its own tokens on SIPs to ensure neutrality"

---

## Technical Implementation Details

### Emission Schedule

The SIP specifies a staggered emission schedule over 60 months:
- **Months 1-11**: 475 STX per anchor block
- **Months 12-23**: 1,140 STX per anchor block
- **Months 24-35**: 1,705 STX per anchor block
- **Months 36-47**: 1,305 STX per anchor block
- **Months 48-60**: 1,150 STX per anchor block

### Token Supply Impact

The proposal temporarily increases Stacks' annual emissions from 3.52% to an average of 5.75%.

### Governance and Voting

#### Enhanced Community Programs
Alexlmiller further clarified intentions in a revised draft:
- "Clarified the intent of the SIP as benefitting ALL builders"
- "Added a 'Community Grants' program"
- Added a "section on burning tokens if the Endowment grows sufficiently"
- "more detail around reporting expectations from the endowment"

## Community Perspectives

### Supportive Perspectives

#### Strong Endorsements

**DekaDub** stated:
> "Really impressed with the direction this SIP is taking. It shows a strong understanding of what the ecosystem needs right now, sustainable growth, aligned incentives, and real builder support. Feels like a turning point!"

**zeroauthority** highlighted:
> "For years, Stacks has been underfunded and slowed down by fragmented operations and regulatory constraints. Even though we've built strong technology like sBTC and Nakamoto, we've lacked the capital, structure, and coordination needed to scale adoption and compete with other top crypto projects. SIP-031 fixes that"

They further emphasized:
> "It creates a new endowment — a dedicated pool of STX tokens — and sets up a more focused operational team to drive growth. This will allow us to fund more developers, support new apps, run marketing campaigns, boost liquidity, and accelerate Bitcoin DeFi adoption"

#### Investment Analogy

**jude** articulated the proposal's strength:
> "I like SIP-031 because it demonstrates a clear understanding of the problems the ecosystem currently faces, and proposes a pragmatic, workable, well-thought-out solution to fix them"

He conceptualized it:
> "as something in-between a Series B raise and the establishment of a crypto developer fund, and I think it's actually better than either of these options because: clear, unambiguous, community-accountable, and amendable governance charter over the fund, with no single points of failure"

jude likened SIP-031 to:
> "something in-between a Series B raise and the establishment of a crypto developer fund," emphasizing its "clear, unambiguous, community-accountable, and amendable governance charter over the fund, with no single points of failure"

He noted that the fund's budget and spending priorities are set upfront, controllable by the community via subsequent SIPs, and based on real-world data from other projects. He also suggested that while an individual's percentage of STX ownership might decrease due to the new emissions, the total value of their holdings could significantly increase due to overall ecosystem growth, akin to a Series B investment in a traditional company.

He also illustrated with a pie chart analogy:
> "Even though you would own less of the total STX, your slice's total area (how much value you hold) is appreciably bigger"

#### Competitive Positioning

**princetroyc** stated:
> "The SIP-031 proposal makes a lot of sense; Stacks needs to reach the top, so I'm just hoping the endowment is used perfectly"

**onceinalifetime** described SIP-031 as:
> "critical. Without significant funding, Stacks can't close the gap with top 10 chains like Solana or Avalanche"

They further noted:
> "The endowment and Ops Entity are smart moves to fund sBTC, DeFi, and tech upgrades, mirroring successful models like Avalanche's Rush"

A key takeaway for them was that:
> "the follow-up execution matters more than the initial idea"

#### Operational Flexibility

**Resh** appreciated the:
> "operational flexibility that regulatory constraints have previously limited, particularly for marketing initiatives"

This refers to establishing entities outside the US for operational flexibility.

### Critical Perspectives

#### Economic Concerns

**PauCity** strongly opposed the:
> "one-time mints rather than following the prior emissions halvings," arguing that it "will further erode user trust in the Stacks ecosystem" and is "not inline with Satoshi's vision at all"

They invoked the "Cantillon Effect," stating:
> "Those closest to the printing events will benefit the most while those down the line receive the least," and reiterated that "Issuing 100,000,000 new STX at once dilutes value"

They further explained:
> "Cantillon Effect: Early recipients (e.g., grant recipients, treasury sales, etc.) can sell new STX immediately, profiting most"

#### Transparency and Accountability Questions

**LNow** sought more context:
> "What actions were taken so far to solve mentioned problems? What was the result? If they failed, do we know why? What caused these problems in the first place? What other solutions have been considered and why they have been discarded?"

They also stated:
> "What I don't understand is why these problems weren't clearly communicated earlier"

**friedger** questioned several aspects:
- Missing "Definition of 'Key Contributor'"
- The exploration of "PoB phase as funding mechanism"
- Shared concerns about the "Cantillon effect"
- Questioned if "10% in operation costs seem a lot for the endowment"
- Asked for clarification on "Why this unmotivated variance in emissions?"
- "What is the total supply by 2050 with and without SIP-031?"
- Whether unused STX would be cancelled

#### Market Impact Concerns

**mark07** expressed concerns about:
> "market pressure from any entity that would be paid off with those newly issued tokens," asserting that "this is an action that depreciates Stacks value in any direction"

He also questioned the transparency of fund allocation, the endowment's exclusion from stacking opportunities, and the accountability setup if located in a foreign country.

**stxbeliever** argued that the proposed:
> "500M STX is just too much," suggesting a smaller mint of "50M/100M $STX for marketing and product development"

#### Reputational Risks

**enjoywithouthey** highlighted "Reputational Risks," stating the SIP:
> "does not adequately address" them

They warned that the initial mint:
> "can and most likely will be interpreted as "money printing" which is a taboo activity in crypto culture," leading to "negative sentiment and media coverage"

They also pointed out that the SIP:
> "does not address nor quantify the impacts to current token holders from dilution" and is the "first Stacks SIP motivated by funding rather than a technical or security upgrade"

#### Philosophical Opposition

**franco_79001** presented an alternative "Treasury Model for the Sovereign Individual" where STX emissions are distributed directly to holders for individual allocation, arguing it's:
> "more moral" and "eliminates dead capital from the treasury"

Upon review of a revised draft of SIP-031, franco_79001 maintained that it:
> "still has a lot of issues: centralized allocation authority remains, emissions are unconditional regardless of real demand, burn mechanisms are delayed and discretionary, there's no built-in path for unused capital, and transparency depends on off-chain reporting"

He critiqued transparency as:
> "not a substitute for consent," calling annual reports "retroactive, not proactive" and on-chain traceability "meaningless when participants cannot influence the flow"

He also broadly criticized the SIP as a move towards:
> "collectivism" against "individualism" in Bitcoin, stating, "If this SIP-031 is passed, then collectivism has won and individualism has failed, in bitcoin, what makes it thrive is individualism and you guys want to do the opposite"

## Stacks Ecosystem Context

### SIP Process

SIPs (Stacks Improvement Proposals) are described as:
> "formal documents that describe the design, implementation, and governance of the Stacks 2.0 blockchain"

> "The SIP process allows for a transparent way to propose and ratify new ideas. Even the SIP process itself is described in one; namely, SIP000"

### Technical Standards

#### Smart Contract Language
Clarity is identified as:
> "the smart contract language on Stacks"

The print function in Clarity is used to:
> "encode a nice message on the blockchain until the end of time" and is used throughout the Clarity book to "show intermediary values"

#### Account Management
The stx-account function allows querying of an STX account, returning:
> "the current amount of unlocked STX, the current amount of locked STX, and the unlock height for any locked STX, all denominated in microstacks"

#### Token Standards

**Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)**
SIP-009 defines Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on Stacks, highlighting that:
> "NFTs short for non-fungible tokens are digital assets with unique identifiers"

The specification for metadata is to be covered in a future SIP.

**Fungible Tokens (FTs)**
SIP-010 defines Fungible Tokens (FTs), with the source noting:
> "Fungible tokens came after for Stacks. Indicative of the numbering, NFTs were"

### Proposed Enhancements

#### Trust Lines
Trust Lines (SIP-XXX) are proposed as a:
> "non-consensus breaking mechanism to facilitate flexible and trust-based token management within the Stacks ecosystem"

Its activation requires:
- The Clarity library to be "developed and publicly available"
- "At least three dApps or applications on the Stacks blockchain have integrated and actively utilize the Trust Line functionality"
- "Documentation and tutorials for using the Trust Lines library are readily available for developers"

#### Bitcoin Name Service (BNS)
The BNS (Bitcoin Name Service) proposal aims to:
> "enhance the current BNS zonefile configuration by integrating additional fields that provide a more comprehensive and versatile approach to defining digital identity on the blockchain"

**dant** suggested standardizing new fields like "pfp" (profile picture) and "social", while **eriq** noted that:
> "the format proposed by @dantrevino is perfect for the goal we are aiming to achieve"

## Philosophical Framework

### Bitcoin Power Projection Theory

#### Author Background
Jason Lowery (the author of "lowery-jplowery-sm-sdm-2023-thesis.pdf") emphasizes his role as a:
> "US Space Force officer and US National Defense Fellow at MIT," whose "job is to keep an ear to the ground and an eye out for emerging power projection technologies"

#### Bitcoin's Unique Position
He argues that Bitcoin:
> "deserves to be treated as something wholly different than so-called "blockchain" or "cryptocurrency" technology" because "Bitcoin is both physically and systemically different than other "cryptocurrency" protocols and is therefore inappropriate to categorize as the same type of technology despite having similar semantic descriptions"

#### Thesis Overview
Lowery states:
> "This thesis explores the significance of Bitcoin's proof-of-work protocol from a broader perspective of computer theory"

He defines his work as a:
> "novel theory called Power Projection Theory", where "physical power (a.k.a. watts) serves many useful functions in nature and society. One of the most useful yet underappreciated functions of physical power in nature is providing living creatures with a basis for settling their disputes, managing their resources, and establishing a pecking order in a zero-trust, egalitarian, and permissionless way"

#### Softwar Concept
On "softwar", Lowery hypothesizes:
> "the emergence of technologies like Bitcoin could indicate that this war has already started, but nobody recognizes it because they don't understand digital-age power projection"

He continues:
> "humanity is going to become so tired of being systemically exploited at unprecedented scales through their computer networks by an elite, tyrannically, and technocratic ruling class, that they are going to invent a new form of electro-cyber warfare and use it to fight for zero-trust and permissionless access to cyberspace and its associated resources (namely bits of information)"

#### Bitcoin as Cyber Defense
He quotes Michael Saylor who described Bitcoin as:
> "a swarm of cyber hornets serving the goddess of wisdom, feeding on the fire of truth, exponentially growing ever smarter, faster, and stronger behind a wall of encrypted energy"

### Computational Efficiency vs Strategic Value

Lowery discusses "computational inefficiency" as a feature:
> "Rarely do engineers discuss the strategic value of endeavoring to biggest, slowest, and most energy intensive computers with smaller and more physically restricted state spaces that have extremely difficult-to-change state mechanisms"

He notes that:
> "Bitcoin enthusiasts have emerged as iconoclasts who are not only unapologetic about the Bitcoin computing network's superfluous energy usage, they also celebrate how computationally difficult it is to run the Bitcoin network"

#### Energy Usage Defense
He makes a provocative assertion:
> "rejecting proof-of-work because it ostensibly uses too much energy is functionally the same argument that pacifists use to condemn warfare"

#### Fundamental Purpose
Lowery concludes that:
> "Bitcoin is fundamentally about Balance-of-Power, not Money"

He suggests that Bitcoin:
> "changes the dynamics of physical power projection and takes control over a precious resource (bits of information) out of the hands of people with imaginary power who cannot be trusted"

#### Human Antlers Analogy
He proposes that:
> "proof-of-work protocols like Bitcoin could function like human antlers," enabling humans to "establish intraspecies dominance hierarchies and determine the right balance of power using non-lethal (i.e. electric) physical power rather than lethal (i.e. kinetic) physical power, but still retain the complex emergent benefits of physical-power-based resource control structures"

#### Economic Philosophy
He quotes Henry Ford saying:
> "If you need a machine and don't buy it, then you will ultimately find that you have paid for it and don't have it"
