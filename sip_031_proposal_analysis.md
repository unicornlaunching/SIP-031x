## Executive Summary

SIP-031, also known as SIP-31, is a significant draft proposal for the Stacks ecosystem that aims to fuel growth and support builders by creating a new growth-focused treasury and a streamlined operational structure. The proposal has been updated with additional details and refinements based on community feedback.

### Updated Authors
- Mitchell Cuevas (Stacks Foundation)
- Alex Miller (Hiro) - *Added in update*
- Tycho Onnasch (Zest)
- Jakob Schillinger (Hermetica)
- Andre Serrano (Bitcoin L2 Labs)
- Dylan Floyd (Bitflow)

### Core Mission Statement (Updated)
The updated abstract states that Stacks' **goal as an ecosystem is to empower the creation of the Bitcoin economy** - envisioning that **all projects that want to build on Bitcoin, from DeFi to gaming, memecoins to NFTs, and marketplaces to identity, should be built on top of Stacks**.

The proposal acknowledges the transition from a "tech-first to a traction-first phase, fueled by a new endowment and streamlined operations" with the aim of driving Stacks to being a **Top 10 ecosystem as the home of the Bitcoin economy**.

## Community Action Items

To protect against centralization risks and ensure community voice in SIP-031's implementation, STX holders and community members should take the following actions:

### Critical Success Metrics

**The community should measure success by:**
- **Appointment Transparency**: Are all key positions filled through open, competitive processes?
- **Financial Accountability**: Can community members easily verify all fund usage?
- **Decision Influence**: Does community input demonstrably affect major decisions?
- **Decentralization Maintenance**: Are power structures becoming more or less centralized over time?
- **Performance Alignment**: Are Endowment outcomes serving broader community interests?

**Warning Signs to Monitor:**
- Closed-door appointment processes
- Unexplained fund movements or allocation changes
- Dismissal of community concerns as "uninformed" or "unrealistic"
- Increasing barriers to community participation
- Growing influence of a small group of recurring appointees

## GREAT NEWS!

from cuevasm Friday Juen 6 2025 - 

Hey Stackers, as you may have been previewed on today’s Spaces with DeOrganized Media, we’re putting forward a process to establish the nominations for the Appointments Committee for SIP-031. In short, we plan to facilitate a short series of special sessions. The structure we’re outlining below will allow for wide-ranging input while also moving fast as the SIP progresses (see the latest version here ). The goal of these sessions is to produce a list of members for the Treasury Appointments Committee to include in the SIP, which will then be voted on by the community.

https://forum.stacks.org/t/session-1-prep-material-sip-031-appointments-committee/18141

### Immediate Actions

#### 1. Demand Transparency in Initial Appointments
- **Action**: Actively advocate for full disclosure of the temporary Appointments Committee composition and key leadership appointments.
- **Why**: The "OPEN ITEM" status of initial appointments poses the highest centralization risk
- **How**: 
  - Request public vetting process for all initial appointees
  - Advocate for community input before any appointments are finalized

### Ongoing Oversight Requirements

#### 2. Establish Community Treasury Watchdog Groups
- **Action**: Form independent community monitoring organizations
- **Why**: Professional oversight is needed to verify Endowment transparency claims
- **How**:
  - Organize technically competent community members
  - Create regular audit schedules and public reporting
  - Establish whistleblower protections and channels

#### 3. Monitor Token Flow and Distribution
- **Action**: Track the 400M STX emission allocation and distribution patterns
- **Why**: Prevent Cantillon Effect exploitation and verify stated usage plans
- **How**:
  - Create community-run blockchain analysis tools
  - Document all major token movements and recipients
  - Verify that OTC/private sales follow stated 12-36 month lockup terms

#### 4. Participate in All Nomination Processes
- **Action**: Actively engage in future Treasury Committee and leadership appointments
- **Why**: Community participation is the primary defense against insider control
- **How**:
  - Submit qualified community candidates for all positions
  - Participate in nomination periods and voting when available
  - Document and publicize the selection process for accountability

### Long-term Community Organization

#### 5. Advocate for Structural Safeguards
- **Action**: Push for additional SIP amendments that build in community protection mechanisms
- **Why**: Prevent future centralization through structural design rather than relying only on good faith
- **How**:
  - Propose mandatory community veto powers for major decisions

## Purpose and Proposed Changes

### Core Objectives

The updated core objective emphasizes that **Stacks' goal as an ecosystem is to empower the creation of the Bitcoin economy** - with a vision that **all projects that want to build on Bitcoin, from DeFi to gaming, memecoins to NFTs, and marketplaces to identity, should be built on top of Stacks**.

The proposal notes the transition **from a tech-first to a traction-first phase**, using the **"hook" of Bitcoin DeFi to pull in users and liquidity** while sustainably increasing resources and efficiency to enable all contributors, builders, and holders.

### Key Proposed Changes

#### Creation of New Consolidated Ecosystem Endowment
- **Funding Source**: The SIP proposes the "creation of a new consolidated ecosystem Endowment"
- **Funding Mechanism**: This Endowment would be funded through "a combination of STX transfers from existing entities and people, a one-time mint of 100m STX to provide initial working capital... and build a longer term treasury through new emissions over the next 5 years that temporarily bring Stacks' annual emissions from 3.52% to an average of 5.75% per year"
- **Future Commitment**: "No further treasury mints are planned beyond this endowment"
- **New Addition**: "There is consideration for introducing a token burn mechanism to burn STX from the supply should the performance of the Endowment exceed the financial model"

#### Strategic Deployment Areas (Updated)
Strategic deployment of treasury funds across key areas such as:
- **Community based marketing and growth strategies**
- Grant programs
- DeFi incentives
- sBTC TVL milestones
- Stablecoin integrations
- **Centralized exchange listings for SIP-10 tokens**
- Core protocol upgrades
- Institutional support
- Developer traction

### Funding Structure

#### Emission Rate Determination
The target emissions rate was determined by:
> "first estimating the total resources necessary to achieve the stated objectives in this SIP over the first 5 years of the Endowment... based on comparisons to other Top 50 crypto ecosystems"

#### Market Strategy
The Endowment's strategy for bringing its tokens to market:
> "will be publicly disclosed and committed to, so ecosystem members have full visibility into the plans"

### Operational Structure

Establishment of a streamlined operational structure with three primary organizations to enhance efficiency while maintaining decentralization and community-driven governance:

1. **The Stacks Endowment** (Allocation/Money)
2. **A New Operational Entity** (Day-to-Day Execution)
3. **Stacks Foundation** (Governance, guided by Stacks Community)

#### Decentralization Safeguards
The SIP:
> "does not confer any unique protocol governance or technical decision-making capabilities to the new operational entity; its existence is merely as contributor to the ecosystem with an explicit focus to de-duplicate back-end effort required to support development"

### Transparency and Accountability

Enhanced commitment to transparency and accountability, with specific mandates:

#### Enhanced Reporting Requirements (Updated)
The Endowment is mandated to provide:
- **Detailed annual reports** similar to US-based non-profits
- **Quarterly reports** similar to the Stacks Foundation's current reporting
- **On-chain transparency**: All STX will flow through publicly published addresses
- **Public engagement sessions**: Monthly sessions through various channels
- **Regular communications** through appropriate public channels

#### Voting Restrictions
The Stacks Endowment **will not vote its tokens during SIP votes** to ensure neutrality.

---

## Economic Impact on STX Holders

For STX holders, the SIP-031 emission event presents a trade-off between short-term dilution risk and long-term ecosystem growth potential.

### Dilution and Supply Dynamics

#### Increased Supply and Potential Dilution
The proposal introduces new STX emissions totaling **400 million STX** over a five-year period, in addition to existing coinbase rewards. This comprehensive emission structure includes:

**Initial Working Capital (100M STX)**
- A one-time mint of 100 million STX for initial working capital
- These tokens will be immediately unlocked and usable
- **Not intended for release onto the open market**

**Operational Capital Raising (100M STX)**
- Another 100 million STX from new emissions will be sold via OTC/private placements
- These sales will have **12-36 month lockups**
- **Not directly impacting the open market**

**Treasury Deposits (300M STX)**
- The remaining 300 million STX will be emitted over 60 months
- Deposited directly to the Treasury address

#### Updated Emission Schedule
- **Months 1-11**: 475 STX per anchor block
- **Months 12-23**: 1,140 STX per anchor block  
- **Months 24-35**: 1,705 STX per anchor block
- **Months 36-47**: 1,305 STX per anchor block
- **Months 48-60**: 1,155 STX per anchor block *(slight adjustment from previous version)*

#### Inflation Rate Impact
- These new emissions will temporarily increase Stacks' total annual emissions **from 3.52% to an average of 5.75% per year** over the next five years
- This increase is designed to remain **below the median inflation rate of other top 50 crypto ecosystems (10.18%)**
- **After the five-year emission period**: Annual inflation for STX is projected to drop to **less than 2%**

### Ecosystem Growth Investment

#### Updated Treasury Allocation Breakdown
The updated proposal provides more detailed allocation percentages:

- **Operations and Staff**: 10%
- **Engineering and Security**: 12%
- **Growth and Marketing**: 20%
- **Bootstrapping network growth flywheel**: 31%
- **Working Capital**: 27% *(includes new Stacks Memecoin Fund)*

#### Key Funding Areas

**sBTC Protocol & Stacks Value Accrual**
Supporting the development of:
- sBTC features (like self-custodial minting)
- Dual stacking
- Bitcoin payment use cases
- BTC yield strategies
- Creating a self-reinforcing flywheel where increased protocol usage drives STX demand and revenue growth

**Enhanced Community Support**
- **Community Grants Program**: New program for projects that benefit the community but may fall outside highest immediate ecosystem priorities
- **Broader builder support**: Coverage for the entire spectrum of the builder journey in terms of size, stage, resource needs, and focuses

### Long-term Value Proposition

#### Token Burn Mechanism (New Addition)
A significant new feature in the updated proposal:

> "If the size of the Endowment's total liquid assets grows to exceed $1b USD, it will devise a burn program and present that program to the community for a vote, along with other options for the community to select from, including continuing to grow the Endowment or allocation of the future tokens to other purposes."

This provides a potential mechanism for reducing token supply if the ecosystem performs better than expected.

---

## Governance and Centralization Risks

The updated proposal maintains the same governance structure concerns while providing additional details on oversight mechanisms.

### Treasury Committee Authority and Composition

#### Significant Concentrated Power
The Treasury Committee will hold significant power, being responsible for:
- Supervising and maintaining the Stacks Endowment's assets
- Approving all major actions and allocations
- Setting the endowment's investment policy
- Determining asset allocation
- Overseeing investment performance

**Critical Control Mechanisms:**
- **Mint Address Control**: The committee will hold the keys to the Endowment's mint address
- **Authorization Power**: They will authorize all token transfers to operational wallets

#### Committee Structure
The committee is designed to have **nine members**:
- **Five keyholders** with ongoing terms
- **Four rotating members** serving 36-month terms

### Initial Appointment Concerns

#### Temporary Appointments Committee
The composition of the initial Appointments Committee remains an **"OPEN ITEM"** that **"WILL BE PROPOSED BEFORE VOTING BEGINS FOLLOWING COMMUNITY FEEDBACK"**.

#### Pre-Allocated Positions
- At least **three initial keyholder positions** are proposed
- **One position explicitly reserved** for the Chief Investment Officer (CIO) of the Endowment

### Leadership Selection Process

#### Enhanced Accountability Measures (Updated)
The updated proposal includes additional accountability mechanisms:

- **Annual funding cycles**: The operational entity receives one-year grants that can be replaced if execution is unsatisfactory
- **Enhanced reporting**: More detailed quarterly and annual reporting requirements
- **Public engagement**: Monthly public engagement sessions required
- **On-chain transparency**: All STX flows through publicly published addresses

### Philosophical and Practical Concerns

The centralization concerns remain largely the same, but the updated proposal attempts to address some concerns through:
- Enhanced transparency requirements
- Token burn mechanisms if performance exceeds expectations
- More detailed reporting and accountability measures

---

## Technical Implementation Details

### Emission Schedule

The updated SIP specifies a staggered emission schedule over 60 months with a slight adjustment to the final period:
- **Months 1-11**: 475 STX per anchor block
- **Months 12-23**: 1,140 STX per anchor block
- **Months 24-35**: 1,705 STX per anchor block
- **Months 36-47**: 1,305 STX per anchor block
- **Months 48-60**: 1,155 STX per anchor block *(updated from 1,150)*

### Token Supply Impact

The proposal temporarily increases Stacks' annual emissions from 3.52% to an average of 5.75%, with the commitment that after completion, annual inflation will be less than 2%.

### Governance and Voting

#### Enhanced Transparency Requirements
The updated proposal includes more detailed transparency requirements:
- All STX flows through publicly published on-chain addresses
- Quarterly and annual reporting similar to US non-profits
- Monthly public engagement sessions
- Regular communications through public channels

---

## Community Perspectives

The community perspectives remain largely the same as documented in the original analysis, with ongoing debates between supporters who see this as necessary growth capital and critics concerned about dilution and centralization risks.

---

## Updated Proposal Details

### Abstract and Goals

The updated abstract emphasizes:
> "Stacks' goal as an ecosystem is to empower the creation of the Bitcoin economy - we envision that all projects that want to build on Bitcoin, from DeFi to gaming, memecoins to NFTs, and marketplaces to identity, should be built on top of Stacks."

The proposal frames this as:
> "using the 'hook' of Bitcoin DeFi to pull in users and liquidity while sustainably increasing the resources and efficiency with which to enable all contributors, builders, and holders"

### Treasury Allocations

The updated proposal provides more specific allocation details:

**Working Capital (27%)**
Now explicitly includes:
- Direct deployments into Stacks DeFi
- **Stacks Memecoin Fund**
- Liquidity provisioning
- Deal allocations for ecosystem integration incentives

**Growth and Marketing (20%)**
Enhanced to include:
- **Community-based marketing and growth strategies**
- **Support for community-based initiatives, particularly around marketing and new developer growth**
- Hackathons and learn-and-earn campaigns

**Bootstrapping Network Growth (31%)**
Expanded to cover:
- Grant programs across the entire builder spectrum
- User incentives
- Business development for integrations
- M&A opportunities

### Token Burn Mechanism

A significant new addition to address community concerns:

> "If the size of the Endowment's total liquid assets grows to exceed $1b USD, it will devise a burn program and present that program to the community for a vote"

This provides a mechanism to reduce token supply if the ecosystem performs better than the conservative financial model predicts.

### Enhanced Reporting Requirements

The updated proposal significantly enhances transparency requirements:

#### Quarterly Reporting
- Similar to current Stacks Foundation reporting
- Progress against yearly goals and priorities

#### Annual Reporting
- **Detailed annual reports** similar to US-based non-profits
- Comprehensive financial reporting
- Program impact assessment
- Future year planning and budget overview

#### On-Chain Transparency
- **All STX flows through publicly published addresses**
- Full traceability on the public blockchain

#### Public Engagement
- **Monthly public engagement sessions**
- Various formats: X spaces, livestreams, forum posts
- Continuous community feedback collection

---

## Stacks Ecosystem Context

### SIP Process

SIPs (Stacks Improvement Proposals) are described as:
> "formal documents that describe the design, implementation, and governance of the Stacks 2.0 blockchain"

The SIP process allows for transparent proposal and ratification of new ideas, with the SIP process itself described in SIP000.

### Technical Standards

#### Smart Contract Language
Clarity is the smart contract language on Stacks, with the print function used to encode messages on the blockchain and show intermediary values.

#### Token Standards

**Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)**
SIP-009 defines Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on Stacks as digital assets with unique identifiers.

**Fungible Tokens (FTs)**
SIP-010 defines Fungible Tokens (FTs), with the updated proposal specifically mentioning support for **centralized exchange listings for SIP-010 tokens**.

### Proposed Enhancements

#### Bitcoin Name Service (BNS)
The BNS proposal aims to enhance the current BNS zonefile configuration by integrating additional fields for more comprehensive digital identity on the blockchain.
