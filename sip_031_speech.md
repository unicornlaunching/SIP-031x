# Address to the Stacks Community: SIP-031

**Steemed Builders, intrepid Users, and steadfast Community Members,**

I am the Stacks God, and I address you from the very heart of the Bitcoin economy, where the security of the ancients meets the innovation of the modern. Today, we gather to speak of a proposal that is not merely an improvement, but a transformation – **SIP-031**. This is our decisive step to accelerate adoption, empower all builders, and drive long-term value for every one of you.

## The Challenge

For too long, Stacks, despite its foundational technology like Clarity smart contracts and its unique connection to Bitcoin, has faced challenges:

- Underfunding
- Fragmented operations
- Lack of clear structure

We have been a tech-first marvel, but the time has come to be a traction-first powerhouse.

---

## Our Vision

> Our vision is grand: to establish Stacks as the unshakable foundation for the entire Bitcoin economy – encompassing DeFi, gaming, NFTs, and identity solutions. We aim to become a Top 10 ecosystem.

---

## The Path Forward: SIP-031

### 1. Creation of the Stacks Endowment

A new, consolidated STX treasury designed to manage and deploy capital for ecosystem growth.

**Funding Sources:**
- STX transfers from existing entities and individuals.
- A one-time mint of 100 million STX.
  > I hear the concerns about "money printing" and dilution, but understand this: this amount was precisely chosen based on extensive economic analysis from third-party experts like Nomiks. It ensures we have sufficient funds to compete at scale, even in scenarios where the token price does not significantly rise. This is not a haphazard act, but a calculated investment in our collective future, to put us on par with other top projects.
- New emissions over five years, temporarily bringing our annual emissions from 3.52% to an average of 5.75%.
  After this five-year period, our commitment is clear: annual inflation will be less than 2%.

**Purpose:**
This Endowment will be a force for growth, fueling strategic efforts to scale Total Value Locked (TVL), liquidity, user adoption through DeFi incentives, sBTC milestones, stablecoin integrations, and grant programs.

### 2. A Streamlined Operational Entity

This new entity will be our day-to-day engine of progress, driving:

- Core protocol development
- Marketing
- Business development
- Partnerships
- Builder relations

> Crucially, it does not gain any unique protocol governance or technical decision-making capabilities. Its existence is purely to accelerate execution and de-duplicate efforts.

It will also administer a "Community Grants" program to support a wider array of projects.

---

### 3. Unwavering Transparency and Accountability

This new structure is built on a foundation of trust, directly accountable to you, the Stacks Community.

- The Stacks Endowment will provide detailed annual reports (like US non-profits) and shorter quarterly reports.
- All STX flows through publicly published on-chain addresses, ensuring full traceability.
- Monthly public engagement sessions through various channels, including X Spaces and livestreams.
- Regular communications to keep you informed of all activities and their impacts.
- The Stacks Endowment will not vote its tokens in SIP votes, ensuring neutrality and preventing undue influence.
- A token burn mechanism:
  > If the Endowment's liquid assets exceed $1 billion USD, a plan for token burn must be presented to the community for a vote. This is a commitment to long-term sustainability and responsible treasury management.

---

### 4. Community-Guided Governance

- The Stacks Foundation will continue to neutrally facilitate the SIP process and provide oversight.
- The Treasury Committee, composed of both existing leaders and community-appointed members, will supervise, approve budgets, and allocate funds from the Endowment.
- **Your voice is paramount:** You will nominate and elect members to this crucial committee.
- The community's governance over the open-source ecosystem, including technical and ecosystem development via SIPs, remains unchanged.

---

## The Benefits for All Stakeholders

### Builders and Developers

- Unparalleled access to capital and liquidity
- Faster-moving technical foundation with increased development velocity for core Stacks and sBTC
- Initiatives like Clarity curriculum development, online learning platforms, virtual workshops, mentorship programs, and hackathons
- Tools like TX2 for sponsored transactions and payment notification tools for easier integration
- AI DevRel solutions like Syndi to reduce FAQ burden

### Holders and Investors

- Improved market dynamics and token value potential through strategic treasury deployment and dedicated financial stewardship

### Users

- Faster access to high-quality applications and DeFi opportunities, powered by ecosystem-wide growth incentives and broader brand awareness
- Innovations like sBTC, which operates trustlessly on-chain (unlike Wrapped Bitcoin, WBTC, which relies on custodians)
- Enhancements to BNS for decentralized identity
- Development of Trust Lines for more flexible token management

## Acknowledge the Challenges, Embrace the Future

> I am aware of the criticisms and challenges that accompany such a bold move. Some question the initial mint and increased emissions, fearing dilution or centralization. Others worry about execution and transparency. Yet, this proposal is a pragmatic, workable, and well-thought-out solution born from extensive feedback from builders and participants. We are not ignoring past lessons; instead, we are applying them to build a more efficient, competitive, and secure ecosystem.

## The Bitcoin Analogy

> Consider Bitcoin itself. As articulated by thinkers like Jason Lowery, Bitcoin's proof-of-work is not just a monetary innovation but a "softwar" protocol that physically secures bits of information by making them physically expensive to produce. This is a fundamental concept of power projection. It allows for zero-trust, permissionless, and egalitarian control over resources by imposing severe physical costs on malicious actors, countering the systemic exploitation that arises from abstract power hierarchies encoded in software. This is how we ensure decentralization, not just in name, but in fundamental reality. Just as Bitcoin is designed to be physically expensive to ensure its security and decentralization, this SIP-031 is designed to be a significant, strategic investment to secure Stacks' future as the leading Bitcoin L2.

---

## Your Vote Matters

To activate this SIP, we require significant community consensus:

- At least **80 million stacked STX** must vote.
- At least **80% of all stacked STX** committed by voting must vote "yes".
- At least **80% of all liquid STX** committed by voting must vote "yes".

> Your vote can be cast with either locked/stacked STX or unlocked/liquid STX via the stx.eco platform.

---

## Conclusion

This is a turning point. SIP-031 is a strategic move, akin to a Series B funding round for a project that has demonstrated product-market fit. It provides the necessary capital and a streamlined structure to onboard the next billion users to Bitcoin through Stacks.

> The future of the Bitcoin economy, built on Stacks, is within our grasp. Let us seize it, together.

**Thank you.**

## Detailed Breakdown: 5-Year Endowment Spending Plan (Nomiks Analysis)

Based on the Nomiks 5-Year Plan, the Endowment's spending and emissions are structured to ensure sustainability, price stability, and maximum impact for the Stacks ecosystem. Here is a detailed breakdown:

### Annual Funding Needs

- **Year 1:** $125M
- **Year 2:** $100M
- **Year 3:** $60M
- **Year 4:** $60M
- **Year 5:** $60M

- **Treasury Emissions:** 300M STX released over 5 years, with emissions dynamically constrained to stay under a 7% annual inflation cap (including PoX emissions).
- **Investor Unlock:** 100M STX allocated to investors, released linearly over 30 months, with tranche-based discounts and lockups:
  - 12M lock: 30% discount
  - 18M lock: 40% discount
  - 24M lock: 50% discount
- **PoX Emissions:** Block rewards per SIP-029 halving schedule (1,000 STX/block until April 2026, 500 STX/block until April 2028, 250 STX/block until April 2030).

### Emission Controls & Price Stability

- **Daily Cap:** No more than $360k USD worth of new tokens sold in any 5-day span, enforced via linear vesting (18-24 months recommended).
- **Inflation Discipline:** Unified 7% annual cap (including all emissions and PoX rewards).
- **Scenario Planning:** Simulations confirm that at $1.00/STX or higher, fundraising fully meets the $405M target; at $0.50/STX, shortfalls may occur.

### Example Emission Schedule (STX)

- **Investor Unlock:** 100M STX over 30 months
- **Treasury Emissions:** 300M STX over 5 years
- **PoX Emissions:** ~131.4M STX over 5 years (per halving schedule)

> The Endowment will adjust emission pacing quarterly, with the ability to defer, recycle, or pause unlocks in response to market conditions, ensuring both runway and price stability.
